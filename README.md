# NorthWindApi
HI This is Mongezi Kasha. A Junior Software Engineer with 1-2 years of experience.

This is a C# RESTFul API. The API is making calls or Requests to a Microsft Created Database called NorthWind. 
This is a simple API to showcase my C# and React Skill. 

What does the project entail?
- The project is a C# API project with unit test (currently kicking my ass).
- With unit tests I'm using Xunit.
- The designs patterns used in this project are the Repository pattern and the specification patterns.
- In future I will be added some front-end for authentication, reading the data, manipulating and deliting data.
- I will intergrade this project with any project that is open source that I deem useful.

Thanks. Stay tuned for more developments.
